## Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare data

## Description
The popularity of the bicycle sharing systems have continuously increased over the years in different cities across the world. The main objective of this system is to provide easy transportation for people of all ages.

The system is designed in a way that allows people pick up the bikes at a point to reach their destination, and they necessarily do not have to return it to the starting point except by choice. The advancement of Information technology has made the system user friendly as it allows the user, irrespective of the type of user to easily access a dock to use the bicycles.

This project utilizes Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used. This project established the patterns of the bike share usage in these cities by computing a variety of descriptive statistics, such as:
- Popular times of travel.
- Popular stations and trip.
- Trip duration.
- User info, i.e., (counts of each user type, counts of each gender, and earliest, most recent, most common year of birth).
